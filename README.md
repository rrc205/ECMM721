# Project Code

This git repository contains the code written by me and used within my project. 
The major codes are contained in the following files:

- **Preprocessing and Preliminaries** - Remaining preliminary work and all the preprocessing and relevance filtering

- **Location extraction and mapping** - Extracts the place data and maps the filtered tweets
